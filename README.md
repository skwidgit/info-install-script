Hi everyone ! (or just you... or nobody......)

You'll find in this little repo, the Information-Installation-Scriptation script...

What the ** is it?

Just a file that includes the informations needed to build the firmware..

First, You'll find some links for the documentations, informations (full infos on real website)
Second, You'll find the packages to install (ok, there is a lot, but! if your system already have them.. no problem then ^^
Third, You'll find the sequentially commands to build the OpenWrt-Tor-Router-Firmware on the Raspberry pi 2...

Why on the Raspberry pi 2 ?
Because I have one... ^^

I also have a Wifi-Dongle with the firmware RTL8188C_8192C_USB_linux_v4.0.2_9000.20130911 that you will find in the folder "Packages-Wifi-Dongle-TDLINK". Why this one ? =========>>> because I have one... ^^
